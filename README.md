# Employee React App


## Initial Setup:
Clone the repository from Github and then run command npm install 

## User Story: 
AS A USER,
I want to be able to pull a random list of users from an API, sort the data by a specific topic, and filter


## Method:
Using react, we are able to create an app that has reusable features, injects data into those reusable features, and pulls data into an array for the purposes of data injection.

## The App Interface:

## Challenges:
Initially, pulling the API data proved to be difficult. After figuring out how to get the API call to work, the challenge was figuring out how to create the reusable elements of the employee.jsx file. Finally, the biggest challenge was creating functionality to sort data and filter. I attempted to get a sort functionality to work, but unfortunately I was unable to complete this.
